### Self-contained docker image for Nitter
In addition to the [regular Nitter docker image](https://github.com/sekai-soft/nitter/pkgs/container/nitter) (plus some minor improvements), this repo also contains the source code and [docker image](https://github.com/sekai-soft/nitter/pkgs/container/nitter-self-contained) for a self-contained wrapper variant of Nitter that makes it easier to customize and run, especially in a PaaS, e.g. the fly.io setup is based on it.

#### Features
* Authenticate with a burner/temporary Twitter account using environment variables
* Customize the instance using using environment variables
* Built-in optional nginx and Redis
    * Nginx with password-protection is included to block malicious scrapers.
    * Redis is included in case some PaaS does not have Redis capability/charge additionally for Redis despite having a free tier.

#### How to use
* The docker image is `ghcr.io/sekai-soft/nitter-self-contained:latest`
* You should sign up and use a burner/temporary Twitter account with 2FA disabled.
* You need a volume mapping into the container path `/nitter-data`
    * This is regardless whether you wish to enable Redis. The volume is needed to persist Twitter authetication info even if Redis is disabled.
* Specify environment variables

| DISABLE_REDIS              | No       | Use `1` to disable the built-in Redis. You should ensure an external Redis instance is ready to connect before launching the container                                                |

| DISABLE_NGINX              | No       | Use `1` to disable the built-in Nginx. **Strongly discouraged if the container is exposed to the Internet.**                                                                          |
| INSTANCE_RSS_PASSWORD      | No       | If the built-in Nginx is not disabled, required password used to protect all `/rss` paths. In order to access them you need to specify a `.../rss?key=<password>` query parameter.    |

* After the container is up, Nitter is available at port 8081 within the container if Nginx is enabled, and at port 8080 within the container if Nginx is disabled.

#### Some inner working details
* Multiple processes are orchestrated by [`overmind`](https://github.com/DarthSim/overmind)
* `/src/scripts/dump_env_and_procfile.sh` was needed before `overmind` can execute
    * `dump_env_and_procfile.sh` writes the `Procfile` of course
    * `dump_env_and_procfile.sh` also writes expected environment variables to `.env` because `overmind` does not seem to inherit environment so [it had to be an `.env` file](https://github.com/DarthSim/overmind?tab=readme-ov-file#overmind-environment)

#### Development of the self-contained docker image
1. You need a `.env` file with the following

```
TWITTER_USERNAME=
TWITTER_PASSWORD=
INSTANCE_RSS_PASSWORD=
INSTANCE_WEB_USERNAME=
INSTANCE_WEB_PASSWORD=
```

For testing `twitter-credentials.json`, remove `TWITTER_USERNAME` and `TWITTER_PASSWORD` in `.env` file and uncomment lines with `twitter-credentials.json` in `docker-compose.self-contained.yml`

2. Run

```
docker compose -f docker-compose.self-contained.yml up --build
```

3. Access the password protected Nitter instance at [`localhost:8081`](http://localhost:8081/)

4. Run integration test `make test`. Docker compose stack logs are exported to `self-contained-test.logs` after the test is run.
